Adding repository information to a prompt
=========================================

git.zsh svn.zsh

These files define three functions to add information about a git or svn repo
to the prompt string:

   git_prompt_prefix
   git_prompt_branch # no svn equivalent
   git_prompt_status

and similarly for svn. Some of these functions take an optional argument,
which can in some circumstances reduce execution times. See each file for
details.

Calling *_prefix or *_branch will simply echo the
prefix (the path from the repository root to the CWD) or branch name,
respectively.

*_status will echo some information about the repository: whether it has any
uncommitted or untracked changes. Its behaviour is controlled by three
variables, which must define both colour and output:
   
   ZSH_THEME_REPO_DIRTY     # printed if there are uncommitted changes
   ZSH_THEME_REPO_UNTRACKED # printed if there are untracked files
   ZSH_THEME_REPO_UNKNOWN   # printed if the status was not inspected
   ZSH_THEME_REPO_CLEAN     # printed if there are no changes

These functions can run slowly on large repositories. Any or all of the repo
functions will be ignored if the CWD contains the file given in

   ZSH_PROMPT_IGNORE

This file contains a brief description of which functions should be ignored:

   all    # don't inspect the repo at all
   prefix # don't try to find the prefix path
   branch # don't try to find the branch name
   status # don't try to analyse the repo status

These words must each appear at the beginning of a line. Any line beginning
with a '#' is guaranteed to be ignored.
